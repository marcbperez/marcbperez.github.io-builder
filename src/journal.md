## [Clean Git branching](clean-git-branching.html)

Branching is essential when working with Git. This article explains how to work
collaboratively while developing new enhancements, releasing them and hot-fixing
issues for those releases. While not official, this is a widely used technique
described in Vincent Driessen's article and implemented in his famous git-flow
extensions.

## [Descriptive Git projects](descriptive-git-projects.html)

The Code itself is not enough. It certainly does the job, but what about project
description, standards, keeping track of changes and legal rights? They are
important points to take into account, especially if we want the project to be
understandable in the long run.

## [Gradle in Docker](gradle-in-docker.html)

Gradle and Docker can work together to provide an isolated environment to build
software projects. Gradle keeps the build process tied up while Docker and
docker-compose provide an independent and configurable environment to construct,
run, test and deploy the task.
