Branching is essential when working with Git. This article explains how to work
collaboratively while developing new enhancements, releasing them and hot-fixing
issues for those releases. While not official, this is a widely used technique
described in Vincent Driessen's article and implemented in his famous git-flow
extensions.

The Code itself is not enough. It certainly does the job, but what about project
description, standards, keeping track of changes and legal rights? They are
important points to take into account, especially if we want the project to be

docker-compose provide an independent and configurable environment to construct,
run, test and deploy the task.
