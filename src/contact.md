# Get in touch

Whether it is for professional purposes, just to say hi or to share feedback and
corrections you can get in touch via [email][email]. I am also available on
[LinkedIn][linkedin], WhatsApp and Telegram in case you need to throw files or
video into the conversation.

> Get in touch via email or phone or head to my Github and Docker Hub profiles
> to see my projects and examples, they are open source and free to use.

You may also want to take a look at my [Github repository][github-repository],
my [Docker Hub][docker-hub] or [Github Gists][github-gists]. Do not hesitate to
fork, use and extend any of the projects. A star is always appreciated if you
find them useful. My packages can be found at [PyPI][pypi], [NPM][npm] and
[Launchpad][launchpad]. I also sell my hardware on [Tindie][tindie].
