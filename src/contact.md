# Get in touch

Whether it is for professional purposes, just to say hi or to share feedback and
corrections you can get in touch via [email]. I am also available on WhatsApp
and Google Hangouts in case you need to throw files or video into the
conversation. In case you want to meet in person, I am based in London and,
sometimes, Barcelona.

> Get in touch via email or phone or head to my Github and Docker Hub profiles
> to see my projects and examples, they are open source and free to use.

You may also want to take a look at my [Github repository][github-repository],
my [Docker Hub][docker-hub] or [Github Gists][github-gists]. Do not hesitate to
fork, use and extend any of the projects. A star is always appreciated if you
find them useful.

# Hire me
