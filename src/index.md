# Who am I

I am a computer scientist and software engineer based in Barcelona. I build
high-quality full-stack applications, fault-tolerant service architectures,
embedded systems and state of the art websites, responsive experiences and
mobile applications.

You may want [get in touch][contact] or head to the [journal].

# What I do

I produce fully tested and documented projects written in Java, Python, C, C++
and GoLang. As for the web, I focus mostly on React/Redux, Material Design and a
static HTML/CSS build system. I combine Git, Gradle, Docker, docker-compose and
several other tools to build highly scalable and fault tolerant solutions which
can be delivered to AWS, Google Cloud Platform or bare metal servers.

I provide scalable and highly available Hadoop/HDFS, Cassandra and PostgreSQL
clusters and I build data analysis and machine learning solutions with Spark,
Pandas and NumPy and I work extensively with the Linux kernel.

# This site

This is my personal effort to share ideas and techniques about general
programming, software engineering, fault-tolerant applications, embedded systems
and hardware design. As an active Open University, UK student, I use
[OU Harvard guide to citing references][ouh-citing-guide]. Do not hesitate to
share corrections or general feedback from the [contact] section.
