# Who am I

It all started with 64K. I will never forget walking into my friend's basement
and seeing his older brother's computer. 386 machines were already on the
market, I had used them and knew them well, but somehow the idea of playing with
an old computer that offered nothing else than a manual and a shell appeared to
be way more interesting.

I was around 10 years old at that time and after that summer I decided that
programming and solving problems were something I wanted to devote my life to.

# What I do

I produce fully tested and documented projects written in Java, Python, C, C++
and GoLang. As for the web, I focus mostly on React/Redux, Material Design and a
static HTML/CSS build system. I combine Git, Gradle, Docker, docker-compose and
several other tools to build highly scalable and fault tolerant solutions which
can be delivered to AWS, Google Cloud Platform or bare metal servers.

I provide scalable and highly available Hadoop/HDFS, Cassandra and PostgreSQL
clusters and I build data analysis and machine learning solutions with Spark,
Pandas and NumPy and I work extensively with the Linux kernel.

# This site

This is my personal effort to share ideas and techniques about general
programming, software engineering, fault-tolerant applications, embedded systems
and hardware design. As an active Open University, UK student, I use
[OU Harvard guide to citing references][ouh-citing-guide]. Do not hesitate to
share corrections or general feedback from the [contact] section.
