# Who I am

I am a computer scientist and software engineer based in London. I build
high-quality applications, fault-tolerant service architectures, state of the
art websites, responsive experiences, mobile applications and embedded systems.
You may want [get in touch][contact] or head to the [journal][journal].

# What I do

I produce fully tested and documented projects written in Python, Java, C, C++
and Node.js. As for the web, I focus mostly on JavaScript, React, Material
Design and a static HTML/CSS build system. I combine Git, Gradle, Docker,
docker-compose and several other tools to build highly scalable and fault
tolerant solutions which can be delivered to AWS, Google Cloud Platform or bare
metal servers.

I provide scalable and highly available microservices and database clusters. I
build data analysis and machine learning solutions with Tensorflow, and I work
extensively with the Linux kernel.

# This site

This is my personal effort to share ideas and techniques about general
programming, software engineering, fault-tolerant applications, embedded systems
and hardware design. As an active Open University, UK student, I use
[OU Harvard guide to citing references][ouh-citing-guide]. Do not hesitate to
share corrections or general feedback from the [contact] section.

The contents of this site are generated from Markdown documents using
[markdown-pages], my static page generator with Markdown support. Feel free to
