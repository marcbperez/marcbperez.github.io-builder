# Who I am

I am a computer scientist and software engineer based in London. I build
high-quality applications, fault-tolerant service architectures, state of the
art websites, responsive experiences, mobile applications and embedded systems.
You may want [get in touch][contact] or head to the [journal][journal].

# What I do

I produce fully tested and documented projects written in Python, TypeScript,
JavaScript, Java, C and C++. As for the web, I focus mostly on React, Redux,
Styled Components and static HTML5 generators. I combine Git, Gradle, Docker and
other tools to build highly scalable and fault tolerant solutions which can be
delivered to AWS, Google Cloud Platform or bare metal servers.

I provide scalable and highly available microservices and database clusters. I
build data analysis and machine learning solutions with Tensorflow, and I work
extensively with the Linux kernel.

# This site

This is my personal effort to share ideas and techniques about general
programming, software engineering, fault-tolerant applications, embedded systems
and hardware design. As an active Open University, UK student, I use
[OU Harvard guide to citing references][ouh-citing-guide]. Do not hesitate to
share corrections or general feedback from the [contact] section.
